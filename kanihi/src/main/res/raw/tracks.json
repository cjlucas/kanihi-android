lovely day to have a slice of humble pie\nOh Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there\nGoing nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us\nAnd we knew it was time to take a chance here\nAnd time to compromise our lives just a little while\nAnd it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons\nBut time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight\n\nAnd we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over\nWhy don't we, sleep all, sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over and over and over and over again\n\nAnd as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide\nIt's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun\nTo swim beneath or over outside till they're reading between the lines\nBut they read none of the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams\nAnd reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to\nWho said it was time, time to take, take love\nTime to take a chance here\nTime to compromise to occupy the lies\nAnd it was time for all the wrong reasons\nbut time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy\n\nSleep all, we sleep all

lightning shocked us\nWhen we were lost and looking down that long Missouri highway\nYour hair was longer then and now I remember\n\nOh the roads unencumbered by cats\nThey're burning like wet matches\nThru my miracle mile mind\n\nYou left your thumb print inside me now for months it seems\nBut mine only brushes your soft surface\nAnd somehow it leaves me listless\nMy tongue curls under my lips oh yes\n\nSo I cant speak to tell you of the months before I met you\nAnd the way the truth it locked us\nRight about the time after the lightning shocked us\n\nWhen we were young and missing\n'round that small new england byway\nOur lives they were sheltered then and I now I remember\nWell its not even being about that anymore\nI gotta get you down\n\nThose tiny fragments of perfection\nThey please me in a time unchanged\nWhen its not the same beginning\nOr a long awaited end\n\nIf I knew all the words\nI would write myself out of here\nIf I was all the colors\nI would paint you pretty in gold\nIn a picture so I'm told little sister\n\nSo now I'm sold little sister\nWhy don't you tell me about the sunsets in Sweden\nAnd the laws of eden\nAnd how you were the rock of Gibraltar\nAnd how they called you foxy\nWell that's another whole box of Pandora's\nThat's another whole box of them ties\n\nSlide your foot off the gas\nBefore we crash right back into the median\nIt separates our house from the middle of the street\nTalking about our house\n\nIs on the front porch telling jokes\nAnd they swing swiftly towards happier times\nExpending lines and finding more energy for the effort\nAnd getting distance from that front porch spotlight\nBut us we found peace in shadows\nLong enough to see a monster die\n\nWe all need to find a little space in our daydreams\nLong enough and just so long\nLong enough, just as long\nJust so long as its long enough\nIs it long enough\nIs it long enough for me\nLong enough for me to chew on\n\nIf it isn't\nIf it isn't\nIf it ain't\nIf it don't\nIf it can't\nThen it won't\nAnd that's just the way that it goes","composer":null,"mood":null,"compilation":null,"comment":null,"duration":250,"track_artist":{"uuid":"93fb20a8-7bc6-4dc8-b146-6e620c96b1b9","name":"Jason Mraz","sort_name":"Mraz,

world of players and private eyes\nUnless you realize this\nThere's a whole lot you could miss\nDo you know which one I am\nI am the cigarette smoking man\nOnce an hour I light the flower\nAnd burn

is flooring me\n\nEarly in the morning\nLate in the evening\nEvening, we kinda get delirious\nBreaking from the seriousness\nI try not to get disoriented\n\nHaving chewed too many up on my side\nIs it any wonder how I miss your smile\nIs it any wonder how I write\nPages layered upon pages\nWhich to no one else but me can be accounted for\nFor this moments sake\n\nI do not become me\nFor path tunnels or straightaways\nI do not watch as often as I should\nSo instead I sketch my life a comfortable creature\nSlow and beautifully\nOh the smell and tastes of the past nights\nWell they're still locked up in my gentle jaw\n\nNot that I am wanting them to go\nJust that they are\nAnd I'm very much aware\nThe madness of slow motion as you move your legs to walk\nI'm very much aware\nOf this

together, Go to the park together,\nIn all of kinds of weather we would share,\nThis common pleasure, with most of human kinds,\nIt was a kind of treasure, one I was surely glad to find,\nAnd I got some right here, And I'm okay, I'm okay\nYou're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha I am alright,\nI answered alright, I'm doin' fine,but ohh bones again are broken,\nThe love is not a token of affection, It's not even a real thing,\nIt's a word, so don't try to buy it out with a ring,\n'cause it's a verb, to love someone, open up and let them in,\nJust don't, just don't be afraid, don't be afraid to set them again,\nThis ain't no heaven, ain't no hell, ain't no in-between,\n'cause there's just too many faces and places in this world,\nThat I ain't never seen, I'm gonna keep on keeping on on,\nI'm gonna reap on being strong, and I got my head on,\n\nThough misconnected, its alright 'cause I do it protected,\nI got a day job, I drive a cheap ride, Sounds like I'm gonna be fine,\nYou only get one life to learn, There's only so many brain cells you can burn,\nAn' life can take a turn, and take away everything that you've earned,\nAnd leave you yearnin' for more more more,\nLife is gonna leave you yearnin' for more more more,\nYour stomach gonna be churnin' wantin' more,\nYou wantin' wantin' some more, you wantin' some more,\nDo you want some?\nDo you want some?\nThen I got some,\nUm (a bunch of times),\nWell I got one right here,\nAnd I'm okay, I'm okay,\nAnd you're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha I am alright.\nI answered alright, I'm doin'

with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor\nSaving me for last but you better not eat me at all\nLiving in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt\nPeople say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things\nInstead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings\nBut it's much too soon to leave this easy life\nPass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife\n\nNow you're about to get cut up or get cut down\nIt's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice\nYou gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold\nBetter shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste\nStop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.\n\nBelieve it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box\nMy stomachs smaller than my eyes\nso I went to see the doctor and he said \"turn your head and then cough\"\nI didn't listen to what he said instead I couldn't wait to get off\nHe said I can have this but I cant have that\nThat I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because\nI ain't the one whose gonna be missing the feast\nJust like you ain't the one who seems to be calming the beast\n\nNow you're about to get cut up or get cut down\nIt's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice\nYou gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold\nBetter shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste\nStop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.\n\nWell if you are what you eat in my case I'll be sweet so come and get some\nI'm so over it.\n\nNow you're about to get cut up or get cut down\nIt s all about the know how all just a matter of taste\nStop telling me the way I gotta play.

for me to love you\nNo it's not a difficult thing.\nIt's not hard for me to love you\nHard for me to love you\nBecause you are the world to me.\n\nYeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place\nEvery man makes a difference\nAnd every mother's child is a saint\nFrom a bird's eye view I can see, we are spiralling down in gravity\nFrom a bird's eye view I can see, you are just like me.\n\nIt's not hard for me to love you\nHard for me to love you\nNo it's not a difficult thing.\nIt's not hard for me to love you\nHard for me to love you\nUnconditionally.\n\nNo it's not hard for me

sunshine)\nThe east-west village\nIs best when the jazz is light\n(Don't blame it on the moonlight)\nI played on the subway lines\nNumber one and the nine,\n(Don't blame it on the good times)\nStrawberry Fields already had yielded the sign\nThat Michael Jackson owned Beatles' rights\n\nLights out, moved out of the big apple city\nTime out, no doubt, you know the drive was pretty obscene\n‘Vert to Plan B, back home with family,\nMechanicsville is misery\nExcept for all o' that Andy's barbeque\nThat you can chew,\nThe misses of the fear knows,(?) the brunswick stew\n\nWhat do you do now that you're back in your room?\nAnd what are all the people gonna think of you ?\nWell I knew what I was gonna be at home to do,\nFor the next three years waiting for my cue\nI'd be working on the songs for the whole world to sing\nAnd I been jerkin' you along to take a ride with me\nBy brushin' up my scat and blues phat jazz chords\nBreak dance pad on the hard wood floorboard\nSlappin' them hands on the child hood headboard\nRomance, sure, lord, I'm 20 years forlorn\n\nBorn as a cancer child who could wail, man,\nDeliverin' the goods because my daddy is a mailman,\nMommy was a banker, her only drank the sanka,\nSista was a taker, so maybe we should thank her\nFor stealin' the scene that helped me get it started,\nI think that all the genes that she absorbed was all retarded\nAnd maybe she's invested in me once or maybe twice\nBut I guess that's best because it kinda broke the ice\n\nFor us old clockin those janitorial nights\nI paid the price to rock nights for a life behind the mike\nMCs around me my best friends found me\nI never liked to be just another out of town G,\nRespectfully, see I'd be down on my knees\nSpellin' C-A-L-L-A-T-T\nPlease please with the eva save-a-lot\nBecause who's the boss is a show I crave a lot\nBut you gotta take a break from the old school\nGotta set a date with the real you\nAnd ya gotta stay away from all that new school too\n'Cause there's a lot that you can say about the just plain truth\nOr consequences, they never will fool me\nI'm mixing up the sentences in case you want to do me\nI got one ready for your ass if you'll excuse me\nI'm Jason Mraz and I just plain blame it on the boogie\n\nI'm gonna blame it on the boogie\nI'm gonna blame it on the boogie\nBoogie boogie\n\n(Toca Rivera introduction)\n\nYou're never gonna guess\nWhere I've been been been\nAnd I have no regrets\nThat I bet my whole checking account\nBecause it all amounts to nothing up in the end\n\nWell you can only count on the road again\nWe'll soon be on the radio dial\nAnd I been payin' close attention to the Willie Nelson style\nLike a band of gypsies on the highway while\nI'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive\nUp the coast MC brag the most\nI'm pickin up my pace and makin' time like space ghost\nRaising a toast to the highway patrol with the most\nI've got my cruise control on coast from Farmville to Memphis\nGraceland and grace fans (?)\nLittle rock oklahoma city to the heartland of Texas\nDon't mess with the Lone Star, man\nMy defenses can't rest, I can't handle the pan\nSo it's off to the land of enchantment to camp it\nAlbuquerque, Roswell, Santa Fe to stamp it\nSend a postcard just the way that I planned\nAnd say I'm on spring break because they won't understand\nThat I'll never be back to the town of my mother\nMessing around with the sound that Virginia is for lovers\nLover lover what what lover number one just made the cut\nLeavin' on the greyhound bus\nOh baby leavin' on a jet plane\nNever knowing when it's gonna be back again\nSan Diego is where I plan to stay\nUntil I move to

here I am\nI'm sitting alone again\nI'm staring up at the sky\nWhich at this lonely moment is my only friend\nAnd suddenly as I gazed upon the night\nWell I notice the stars\nThey began to shake and dance and burst\nAnd fall into the darkness\nThey exploded down\nI knew what I had to do\nI ran up to the top of the hill\nAnd I took ahold for you\nYou were the sweetest star that fell\nAnd yes, I held onto it close\nTo the numbness in my heart\n\nAnd then I kissed a star\nYes I did\nI wrapped it up inside of a golden bow\nAnd then I ran away\nJust to find you\n'Cause this was your gift\nYour gift\nOh shit\nA star that I kissed\nOh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes\nWas in need\nI said it was in need\nOf a, of a brand new shining light\nI said I wished to the dark sky above\nThat all I had was to be captured\nAnd willingly turned over to you\nI know you better now\nAnd at this I smile\nI simply gave to you\nThe symbol of what you are to me\nYou are the star that shines\nAnd explodes with light\nAnd I love and embrace\nLove and embrace all that I can\nYou better take this blindess and stay away from me\nAnd let me bask inside of your golden seam\nI never knew such simple astronomy\nI never knew it could come to me\nAnd not by the ways of the heart\n\nAnd call on me\nTo be one of those strangely dressed wise men\nWho follow the stars to their love\nYou are such a perfect star to wish upon\nWell I love you and god and I'm hopeful\nOf what this lonely night may lead me to\nSo I said, God I'm hopeful\nOf what this lonely, lonely night\nWill lead me tonight\nOh well, well i'm hopeful that this lonely night\nWell it shines so right\nI'm hopeful\nI'm hopeful of all good things\nTo come about\nI'm wishing upon you now\nYeah, I'm wishing upon you now\n\nFree me and let me indulge my view\nOh most beautiful you\nKeeper of starlight\nTake on me\nOh, oh, oh\nWell here I am\nI'm sitting all by myself again\nI stare up at the sky\nWhich at this moment is my only friend\nSay well, suddenly as I gazed upon the night\nWell i notice the stars\nThey began to shake and burst\nOh it looks like they want to fight, no\nThey were dancing\nThey were romancing\nOh, they were falling in love\nThey falling in love all over\nFalling in love all over\nFalling in love, falling in love, falling in love\nI say falling in love, falling in love all over\nFalling in love, is my best friend\nFalling in love all over,\nAll over again","composer":null,"mood":null,"compilation":null,"comment":null,"duration":339,"track_artist":{"uuid":"93fb20a8-7bc6-4dc8-b146-6e620c96b1b9","name":"Jason Mraz","sort_name":"Mraz,

passenger's\nSide but not along for the ride\n'Cause I have control of a home grown situation\nI lay back and then I turn the alarm off and turn out the light\nThere's goin' to be some quality sleeping\n'Cause quality's keeping the quality up at night\nI am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly\n\nThrough the darkest space\nWhere I try to catch up to the catch phrase\nTo human race I say let the games begin\nUnder way say in conditions that we play in\nMaybe things are better this way\nMay the games begin today awww\n\nOh well...Cause I'm just above\nThe aggravation of love\nand I raise to optimistical fortune and toasting it twice\nI'm sitting high on an anytime any day night\nAnd I laugh to think I'm crying my eyes out well isn't it nice\n\n(Chorus)\n\nAn open

standing here right in front of you\nSo if you just open your eyes, oh what a sweet discovery\nThere is hope, and there is joy and there is acceptance\n\nSo now let all the light that collects on your plants keep you warm, make you\nsmile\nAnd I will be there with this pen in my hand to record all the while\nYou'll be laughing so loud that the house will shake with sound\nAnd everything will be as new as the day it was found\n\nOh, love is real it is not just in long-distance commercials\nOr something that you thought you felt back in high school\nSo I will turn black and white become that horoscope you're reading\nIt predicts that something good is on its way\n\nAnd I'll send you all the world green and blue in a box through the mail\nYou can open it up, hold it right in your hand and be glad that it's there\nAnd be glad that you're there\n\nNow you can feel all the knots in your stomach they start to untie\nAnd suddenly it's not so hard to say you're alright\n\nOh, love is real it is not just in poetry and stories\nIt is truth and it will follow you everywhere you go from now on\nSo if you just cast all off your doubts then your lips would answer for you\nOh, my darling when you smile it is like a song\nI can hear it now\nAnd I can hear it

lie down\nWell my mind just gets away\nI can't even close my eyes now\nBetween the big fish ambition, and the lovers\nUsing words as ammunition\nBetween wood planks I've been pacing endless\nImpossible dream that I've been chasing\n\nOh God why you been\nHanging out in that ol' violin\nWhile I've been waiting for you, to pull me

like mountains\nIn the sky are next to mountains anyway\n\nDidn't have a camera by my side this time\nHoping I would see the world with both my eyes\nMaybe I will tell you all about it\nWhen I'm in the mood\nTo lose my way but let me say\n\nYou should have seen that sunrise\nWith your own eyes\nIt brought me back to life\nYou'll be with me next time I go outside\nNo more 3x5's\n\nGuess you had to be there\nGuess you had to be with me\nToday I finally overcame\nTryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame\nMaybe I will tell you all about it\nWhen I'm in the mood\nTo lose my way but let me say\n\nYou should have seen that sunrise\nWith your own eyes\nIt brought me back to life\nYou'll be with me next time I go outside\nNo more 3x5's\nJust no more 3x5's","composer":null,"mood":null,"compilation":null,"comment":null,"duration":348,"track_artist":{"uuid":"52e683ba-4135-4ec7-9d28-2d7c9a54264a","name":"John Mayer","sort_name":"Mayer,

will spin on its axis\nAnd find me on yours\n\nDon't say a word, just come over and lie here with me\n'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see\nI want you so bad I'll go back on the

have the right to fly\nAnd will when it gets compromised\nTheir hearts say 'move along'\nTheir minds say 'gotcha heart'\n'Let's move it along'\n\nAnd airports see it all the time\nWhere someone's last goodbye\nBlends in with someone's sigh\nCause someone's coming home\nIn hand a single rose\n\nAnd that's the way this wheel keeps working now\nThat's the way this wheel keeps working now\nAnd I won't be the last\nNo I won't be the last\nTo love her\n\nYou can't build a house of leaves\nAnd live like it's an evergreen\nIt's just a season thing\nIt's just this thing the seasons do\n\nAnd that's the way this wheel keeps working now\nThat's the way this wheel keeps working now\nAnd you won't be the first\nNo you won't be the first\nTo love me\n\nYou can find me\nIf you ever want again\nI'll be around the bend\nI'll be around the bend\nI'll be around\n\nAnd if you never stop when you wave goodbye\nYou just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again\nYou just might wave hello again\n\nAnd that's the way this wheel keeps working now\nThat's the way this wheel keeps working now\n\nYou can't love too much one part of it\nYou can't love too much one part of it\n\nI believe that my life's gonna see\nThe love I give returned to me","composer":null,"mood":null,"compilation":null,"comment":null,"duration":332,"track_artist":{"uuid":"52e683ba-4135-4ec7-9d28-2d7c9a54264a","name":"John Mayer","sort_name":"Mayer,
